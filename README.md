# Image Slider Carousel

**Objective:**  
Your task is to implement an image slider (carousel) component with basic functionality. The slider should allow users to navigate through images manually and automatically, using controls for previous/next navigation, as well as play/stop functionality for automatic cycling.

## Requirements:

1. **Previous/Next Navigation:**

   - Implement buttons to navigate to the previous and next images in the slider.
   - The user should be able to manually click these buttons to move forward or backward between images.

2. **Play/Stop Functionality:**

   - Add a "Play" button that automatically cycles through the images at regular intervals.
   - Add a "Stop" button that stops the automatic cycling when clicked.
   - While in play mode, the slider should loop continuously through the images.

3. **Bare Minimum Animation:**

   - Implement a simple sliding animation when transitioning between images.
   - You do not need to focus on advanced CSS or animationsâ€”just ensure basic functionality for sliding images is present.

4. **Optional:**
   - If you are comfortable with CSS, try enhancing the visual appearance of the slider with smooth transitions.
